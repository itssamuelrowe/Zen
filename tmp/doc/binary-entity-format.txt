 * Representation of a entity file, more appropriately a binary tape, encoded
 * in the Binary Entity Format (FEB). It consists of an array of bytes.
 * Muti-byte quantities which occupy 2 bytes, 4 bytes, and 8 bytes are
 * constructed by reading two, four, and eight consecutive bytes, respectively.
 * These bytes are always stored in big-endian order.
 *
 * Every entity file contains the definition of a single primary entity: class,
 * interface, annotation, or enumeration.
