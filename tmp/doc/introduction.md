## Why another programming language?

At college, I saw my fellow students struggle to learn C. I wanted to help them
and many others around the world like them. So I started working on a language
beginners could learn easily. I called this language Zen. I had a few years of
experience working with C and Java. Naturally, the language was inspired by C,
Java and other languages that I briefly encountered, including Python, Ruby,
and Lua. 

During this period, I worked as a freelancer along with my friends. I would
always turn to Java and the Spring framework to write server-side applications.
There is no denying that Java and Spring are very powerful. However, I soon
realized that they were probably not the best tools for developing applications
quickly.

I could have learnt other technologies such as JavaScript/NodeJS, Ruby/Rails,
or Python/Django. In my defense I did try to learn them, but I wasted my time
jumping from one technology to another. Because, this may sound silly, I was
obssesed with doing things the Java way. This was another reason why I chose to
develop a brand new language. After all, I would learn so much developing a new
language.

I saw an oppurtunity here: Zen could be moulded into the technology I desperately
wished for.

I took the following measures to make the language easy:
 * Removal of redundant tokens
 * Dynamic typing
 * Automatic memory management
 * Simplified object-oriented programming
 * Partially interpreted
