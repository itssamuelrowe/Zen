 * [Instruction (or Mnemonic) Nomenclature]
 *
 * Format: name_[_modifier_][wide][array][sign][primitive_type][index]
 *
 * [modifier]
 * A modifier is local to the instruction. It indicates the modified primary
 * operation the instruction performs. This part is rarely seen in the ZVM
 * instruction set.
 * [Wide]
 * An instruction may have an extended version where the size of one or more
 * input data is wider than the normal version. Such instructions are marked
 * with 'w'.
 *
 * [Array]
 * An instruction which operates on one or more array references is marked
 * with 'a'.
 *
 * [Sign]
 * Albeit the ZVM does not support unsigned integers in general, certain
 * instructions interpret signed and unsigned properties of an integer value.
 * Such instructions are marked with one of the following characters:
 * 's' - signed (This marker is usually omitted.)
 * 'u' - unsigned
 *
 * [Primitive Types]
 * Certain instructions have multiple version which operate exclusively on
 * a primitive type. Such instructions are marked with one of the following
 * characters:
 * 'b' - byte
 * 's' - short
 * 'i' - integer
 * 'l' - long
 * 'f' - float
 * 'd' - double
 * 'a' - reference
 *
 * [Index]
 * Certain instructions operate on data at a specified index. The meaning of
 * the index is local to the instruction in question. In order to enhance the
 * performance of the virtual machine, these instructions usually have hybrid
 * versions which operate on predefined indexes. Such instructions are marked
 * with {@code 0} or any of the positive integers.
 *
 * [Examples]
 *
 * NOTE: These instructions are completely imaginary and have no special
 *       meaning to the virtual machine. They are here merely to help the
 *       reader understand the nomenclature.
